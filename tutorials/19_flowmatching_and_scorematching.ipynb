    "# Flow-Matching Posterior Estimation (FMPE) and Neural Posterior Score Estimation (NPSE)\n",
    "\n",
    "`sbi` also incorporates recent algorithms based on Flow Matching and Score Matching generative models, which are also referred to as Continuous Normalizing Flows (CNF) and Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM), respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the highest level, you can conceptualize FMPE and NPSE as tackling the exact same problem as NPE, i.e., estimating the posterior from simulations, but replacing Normalizing Flows with different conditional density estimators. \n",
    "\n",
    "Flow Matching and Score Matching, as generative models, are also quite similar to Normalizing Flows, where a deep neural network parameterizes the transformation from a base distribution (e.g., Gaussian) to a more complex one that approximates the target density, but they differ in what this transformation looks like (more on that below). \n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond that, Flow Matching and Score Matching offer different benefits and drawbacks compared to Normalizing Flows, which make them better (or worse) choices for some problems. For examples, Score Matching (Diffusion Models) are known to be very flexible and can model high-dimensional distributions, but are comparatively slow during sampling.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we take a brief look at the API for `FMPE` and `NPSE`, their pros and cons, as well as highlight some notable options.\n",

    "Flow-Matching Posterior Estimation (FMPE) is an approach to Simulation-Based Inference\n",
    "(SBI) that leverages Flow Matching, a generative modeling technique where the\n",
    "transformation from a simple base distribution (like a Gaussian) to the target\n",
    "distribution is learned through matching the flow of probability densities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concept:\n",
    "- **Flow Matching**: The core idea is to model the probability flow between the base\n",
    "  distribution and the target distribution by minimizing a discrepancy between their\n",
    "  \"flows\" or \"dynamics\" in the latent space. This is typically done by training a neural\n",
    "  network to parameterize a vector field that defines how samples should be moved or\n",
    "  transformed in order to follow the target distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step-by-Step Process:\n",
    "1. **Base Distribution**: Start with a simple base distribution (e.g., Gaussian).\n",
    "2. **Neural Network Parameterization**: Use a neural network to learn a vector field\n",
    "   that describes the flow from the base distribution to the target distribution.\n",
    "3. **Flow Matching Objective**: Optimize the neural network to minimize a loss function\n",
    "   that captures the difference between the flow of the base distribution and the target\n",
    "   distribution.\n",
    "4. **Sampling**: Once trained, draw samples from the base distribution and apply the\n",
    "   learned flow transformation to obtain samples from the approximate posterior\n",
    "   distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "FMPE can be more efficient than traditional normalizing flows in some settings,\n",
    "especially when the target distribution has complex structures or when high-dimensional\n",
    "data is involved (see Dax et al., 2023, https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17161 for an\n",
    "example). However, compared to (discrete time) normalizing flows, flow matching is\n",
    "usually slower at inference time because sampling and evaluation of the target\n",
    "distribution requires solving the underlying ODE (compared to just doing a NN forward\n",
    "pass for normalizing flows). \n",

    "# NPSE\n",
    "NPSE approximates the posterior distribution by learning its score function, i.e., gradient of the log-density, using the denoising score matching loss. The class of generative models is referred to as score-based generative models, with close links to diffusion models.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Score-based generative models have been shown to scale well to very high dimensions (e.g., high-resolutions images), which is particularly useful when the parameter space (and hence, the target posterior) is high-dimensional.\n",
    "- On the other hand, sampling can be slower as it involves solving many steps of the stochastic differential equation for reversing the diffusion process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that only the single-round version of NPSE is implemented currently.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more details on score-based generative models, see [Song et al., 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.13456) (in particular, Figure 1 and 2)."
